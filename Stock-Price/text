The first argument \\$ is a regular expression pattern. The double backslash (\\) is used to escape the dollar sign because the dollar sign has a special meaning in regular expressions (it matches the end of a line). By using \\$, we are specifying that we want to match the actual dollar sign character.
The second argument "" specifies the replacement string. In this case, we're replacing the dollar sign with an empty string, effectively removing it.
So, gsub("\\$", "", data$tuition_and_fees) is replacing all occurrences of the dollar sign in the tuition_and_fees column with an empty string, effectively removing it. This allows you to convert the resulting character values to numeric using as.numeric()
