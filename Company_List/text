most_outstanding_value <- names(sort(table(data$highly_rated_for), decreasing = TRUE))[]
print(most_outstanding_value)

- table(data$highly_rated_for) generates a frequency table of unique values in the highly_rated_for column.
- sort(..., decreasing = TRUE) sorts the table in descending order based on the frequencies.
- names(...) extracts the names of the sorted table.
- which.max(...) returns the index of the maximum value, which corresponds to the most frequent value.
- [1] extracts the first (most frequent) value from the sorted table.

 geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, color = "black", size = 3)
 - add geom_text() to add text labels to the bars, where label = count maps the count values to the labels.
 - vjust = -0.5 adjusts the vertical position of the labels to place them slightly above the bars.
 - color = "black" sets the color of the labels to black.
 - size = 3 adjusts the size of the labels.
 
 EXPLANATION
- vjust: It stands for "vertical justification" and determines the vertical position of the text relative to its reference point.
A value of 0 positions the text at the bottom of the label bounding box.
A value of 0.5 positions the text at the middle of the label bounding box.
A value of 1 positions the text at the top of the label bounding box.
Negative values position the text below the reference point, and values greater than 1 position it above.

- hjust: It stands for "horizontal justification" and determines the horizontal position of the text relative to its reference point.
A value of 0 positions the text at the left of the label bounding box.
A value of 0.5 positions the text at the center of the label bounding box.
A value of 1 positions the text at the right of the label bounding box.
Negative values position the text to the left of the reference point, and values greater than 1 position it to the right.

stat = "identity" ensures that these values are used as-is for plotting.
